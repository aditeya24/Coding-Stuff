# ðŸ“˜ Learning & College Code Repository

This repository contains code I've written either as part of my **college curriculum** or while **learning on my own**. It's a personal archive of small programs, experiments, and practice exercises â€” not a complete record, but a place to store selected pieces of code.

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside

- **Binary Search in Multiple Languages**  
  Implemented as a small exercise in various languages:
  - Python (`binarySearch.py`)
  - C (`binarysearch.c`)
  - C++ (`binarysearch.cpp`)
  - Java (`BinarySearch.java`)
  - JavaScript (`binarysearch.js`)
  - Go (`binarysearch.go`)
  - Rust (`binarySearch.rs`)
  - Haskell (`BinarySearch.hs`)
  - Ruby (`BinarySearch.rb`)
  - Elixir (`binarysearch.exs`)

  *Note: Some compiled or generated files (like `.class`, `.o`, `.hi`) are included as a result of building/running the code.*

- **Python Code from Lab Sessions**  
  Small programs and exercises done during college lab sessions.

- **C Programs from Labs and Lab Exams**  
  Includes both routine lab work and solutions to exam questions.

More content will be added over time as I continue to learn and work through college-related coding tasks.

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

This repo helps me:
- Store and share code written for college
- Keep a record of what Iâ€™ve learned
- Revisit and improve older code
